*****Description:************************************************************

CountOccurrenceOfNumbers.java:
 * This program reads an unspecified number of integers and finds the one that has the most occurrences. 
 * The input ends when the input is 0. For example, if you entered 2 3 40 3 5 4 –3 3320, the number 3 occurred most often. 
 * If not one but several numbers have the most occurrences, all of them should be reported. For example, since 9 and 3 appear 
 * twice in the list 9 30 3 9 3 2 4, both occurrences should be reported.
